      <h3>How Everything Started</h3>
      <p>
        The Ford Mustang is a very iconic generations of muscle cars. Since the
        start, the Mustangs have been used for drag racing, drifting, track
        racing, and many other performance/racing events. A lot of people modify
        their Mustangs to get better ride quality and more power. When Ford saw
        how many of their customers were doing all these events and work to get
        their cars run faster, they decided to create a more track focused
        Mustang, with the name of Cobra R. These Mustangs came with all the
        necessary modifications for it to run fast and perform excellent in the
        tracks. The Cobra R, comes with all the unnecessary stuff removed, like
        the AC, radio, back seats, etc. And Ford added a big engine with great
        brakes and suspension, for it to run smooth and fast.

      <h3>Present and Future of the Performance Mustangs</h3>
      <p>
        <br />There hasn't been a new Cobra R, the last Cobra R was in the year
        2000. Then, 2004 was the last year in which the name Cobra was used,
        from 2005 until today, the new "Cobras" are the Shelby GT500 or Shelby
        GT350. Now, this doesn't mean that Ford stopped developing
        track/performance/racing Mustangs, Ford continued creating GT500, GT350,
        and the Boss 302, which still give a lot of power to perform in the
        tracks or other performance events. So, the only new Mustang that can be
        directly related with the Cobra R, can be the GT350R, which comes
        without the back seats, and they are offered without the AC and radio.
        The GT350R got a bigger engine compared to the rest of Mustangs, the
        same happened with the Cobra R, they also offered a bigger engine
        compared to the other ones at that time. Ford is still in the racing
        scene and performing like no other!
