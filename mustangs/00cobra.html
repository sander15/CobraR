      <h3>More Information</h3>
      <p>
        <br />
        After Ford didn't release any new Cobra R between 1996 and 1999, the
        Cobra R was back in 2000. This time the Cobra R had a lot more power,
        this time they replaced the 5.8L V8 with a 5.4L V8, even with this
        smaller engine compared to the one found in 1995, this Cobra R still
        made impressive power. As a tradition, the Cobra R was only offered in
        one color, this time it was the "Performance Red". This was the first
        mustang that came with a 6-speed transmission from the Ford factory.
        This Cobra R, came with a lot of more performance enhancements, compared
        to the other ones, this time it came with a side exit exhaust from
        Borla, a functional rear wing, a front splitter, Brembo brakes, Recaro
        Seats, and many other performance enhancements, with the idea in mind to
        keep the car on the track and the driver in a good position. There were
        only made 300 of these 2000 Cobra R.
